## Introduction

BiblioCat is a Web Application to aid in the crowdsourced tracking and managing of information about your favorite Authors, Books, Publishers, Series, and Conventions. With the current design, the user may create, edit, update, and delete (Authors, Books, Publishers, Series, and Conventions). Then, once those items are created, they may be added/connected to each other through specific menus dedicated to that purpose.

In the remainder of this ReadMe, an "object" is a reference to a specific Author, Book, Series, Publisher, or Convention.

## Installing / Getting started

There are not any installation requirements.

to navigate to the Author, Book, Series, Publisher, and Convention pages where you will be able to manipulate those items.

On any page, you can use the navigation bar on the top to go to a specific list page.

If you are using a device with a narrower screen, you can reveal these NavBar options by clicking on the hamburger menu on the top right of the screen.
