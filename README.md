## Introduction

BiblioCat is a Web Application to aid in the crowdsourced tracking and managing of information about your favorite Authors, Books, Publishers, Series, and Conventions. With the current design, the user may create, edit, update, and delete Authors, Books, Publishers, Series, and Conventions. Then, once those items are created, they may be added/connected to each other through specific menus dedicated to that purpose.

## Installing / Getting started

There are not any installation requirements.
